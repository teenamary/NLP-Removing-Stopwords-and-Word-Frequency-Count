# NLP-Removing-Stopwords-and-Word-Frequency-Count
The program contains NLP tasks like removing stop words from a given text. I have used both general method as well as used the NLTK module for it. Along with the in-built stopwords, I have also coded on how to make a list of custom stopwords and remove them from the text. Another feature of the program is counting the frequency of occurrence of words in the text. Along with that, codes to find the most common as well as the  least common words are also included. Plus, the code to find all the words that are greater than or less than a particular frequency is also included.
